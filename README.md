## Expressions and operators

### Operators

JavaScript has the following types of operators:

[Assignment Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators) This operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right oeprand. 

[Comparison Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators) This operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.

[Arithmetic Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#arithmetic_operators) This operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.
