## Expressions and operators

### Operators

JavaScript has the following types of operators:

[Assignment Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators) This operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. 

[Comparison Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators) This operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.

[Arithmetic Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#arithmetic_operators) This operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. 

[Bitwise Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#bitwise_operators) This operator treats its operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros & ones), rather than as a decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers.

[Logical Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#logical_operators) This operator is typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value.

[String Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#string_operators) In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.

[Conditional (ternary) operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#conditional_ternary_operator) This is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition. 

[Comma Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comma_operator) This operator (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand. 

[Unary Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#unary_operators) This operator is an operation with only one operand.

[Relational Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#relational_operators) This operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true. 

### Expressions

An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value. JavaScript has the following expression categories:

-Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example, 9.51413 (Generally uses arithmetic operators)

-String: evaluates to a character string, for example, "John" or "483" (Generally uses string operators)

-Logical: evaluates to true or false. (Often involves logical operators)

-Primary Expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.

-Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.
